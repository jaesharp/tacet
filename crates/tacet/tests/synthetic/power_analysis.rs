//! Power analysis and sensitivity tests.
//!
//! These tests verify the statistical power properties of the timing oracle
//! with rigorous trial counts for tight confidence intervals:
//!
//! - Threshold-relative power curve: Tests power at multiples of θ
//! - Large effect detection: Confirms high power for obvious timing differences
//! - Negligible effect FPR: Confirms low detection rate for sub-resolution effects
//!
//! Run with: cargo test --test synthetic -- power --nocapture
//! Expected runtime: ~5-10 minutes
//!
//! Note: These tests may skip trials that return Unmeasurable outcomes (e.g., due to
//! system noise or lack of high-precision timing). If too many trials are unmeasurable,
//! the test will be skipped entirely.
